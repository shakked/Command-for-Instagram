## Privacy Policy

Last Updated January 27, 2018

Thank you for visiting Shakd, LLC and our Service (“Shakd Apps”). Your privacy is important to us. This notice explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is used at our Service.

## The Information We Collect

We do not collect personally identifiable information about you - such as your name, address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, etc. – unless you choose to complete registration and become a Member.

We do automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our Service. We call this information “Anonymous Data”. Anonymous Data is non-personally identifiable information about your use or the aggregate use of all users that allows us to provide analytics and information on application or Instagram performance, trends, and other metrics that may be useful to users or us. Anonymous Data includes, but is not limited to, the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g. Comcast, Verizon FIOS, etc.), the country a mobile device is used in, the time zone of use, the type of mobile device, non-personally identifiable information about use or performance of an Instagram account, and similar information. 

## How We Normally Use Information About You

We use non-personally identifiable information to analyze site usage, which allows us to improve the design and content of our site. These activities may include, but are not limited to:

Administering, protecting, operating and maintaining the Service and our systems;
Improving the navigation and content of our Service, system administration and security;
Compiling aggregated statistics about the site usage and to better understand the preferences of our site visitors;
Carrying out research and development to improve our services;
Carrying out other legitimate business purposes, as well as other lawful purposes about which we will notify our visitors.
Generating reports concerning hashtag use, Instagram trends, and other information about the Instagram environment.

In the ordinary course, we use personally identifiable information you provide solely to respond to your inquiry or process an application form you have completed on various sections of our Service. These activities may include, but are not limited to:

Responding to your specific inquiry or request and providing you with information and access to resources that you have requested from us;
Processing and completing business transactions and sending related information, including transaction confirmations, document executions, invoices, and payments;
Sending information to you about your account, technical alerts or updates, and other administrative or service-related communications;
Helping personalize your experience on our Services (for example, we may use IP addresses to approximate your general location such as city and state for purposes such as to provide information on local promotions and events);
Helping deliver our services to our visitors and providing customer service and support.

We will not contact you about other matters, unless you specifically request it, nor will we share, rent, or sell your personally identifiable information outside Shakd Apps, except where we are required to share your information with any third parties who provide services on our behalf. 

However, it is possible, though unlikely, that we might be forced to disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency's request. 

Also, we cannot guarantee the privacy of personal information you transmit over the web or that may be collectable in transit by others, including third parties who provide services to us.

## Revoking Consent to Collect or Use Information

You may opt out of collection and use of personally identifiable information at your request at any time, but this may affect our ability to appropriately serve you. You may also access your profile upon request. We do not directly collect any information related to payment cards. For more on this please see the Security section below.

## Sharing Information With Third Parties

Shakd Apps may from time to time engage third parties to preserve, analyze or otherwise store or manipulate data received by Shakd Apps from its customers and to maintain records that allow us to efficiently communicate with you and provide, recommend appropriate services, execute documents, provide invoices, and collect payment. In all such cases, third party service providers will be required to treat all such data with the same degree of care as Shakd Apps and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy.

## Analytics & Advertising

We may use cookies (See “What Are Cookies” below) in order to facilitate the use of analytics tools and/or similar applications designed for measuring Service performance (collectively “Analytics”), with respect to our users. We may use personally identifiable information together with Analytics to track and analyze the web pages visitors visit so that we can better understand and improve our services.

We do not deliver third party online advertisements on our Service, but we may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads for our services when you access and use other Services, based on the information relating to your access to and use of our Service, as well as information received from third parties. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through use of pixel tags).

## Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors

Our site contains links to other sites, including social media sites and applications, whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

## Security

We take precautions to protect your information. We use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a secure data environment, however we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. Ordering online for a Shakd Apps product or service is secure and convenient. Our ordering process is protected by the Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") protocol, which encrypts your information and confirms the identity of the Shakd Apps server before completing your transaction. Netscape Navigator 2.0 + (or better) and Internet Explorer 3.0+ (or better) support the SSL protocol. We recommend you use the latest browsers to ensure that you are protected by advances in security technology. Only input credit or debit card information in the appropriately marked places in our registration materials. Please do NOT include this information in any other communication on our Messaging Services or other communication.  

## What are Cookies?

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's mobile device or computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer's hard drive for an extended period of time. Your browser's help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by Shakd Apps to track user preferences while the User is visiting the Service. They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies may be used by Shakd Apps to store whether, for example, you want your password remembered or not, and other information. Cookies used on the Service do not contain personally identifiable information.

## Disabling/enabling cookies

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled.  

We may use cookies in the following ways:

Where they are essential to make our site work
To enable the personalization features on our Service
To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our Service and to help us improve the structure of our Service. We cannot identify you personally in this way.

## Log Files

Like most standard Services, we use log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. However, none of the information stored in our log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to personally identifiable information.

## Revisions to our Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to revise this policy or any part of it from time to time. Please review the policy periodically for changes. We will notify you of any material changes we make and you will have the opportunity to opt out at that time.
